## We are analysists and our focus area is cealing

## A2b: Identify claim

### The report we have chosen is building 2410
### The claim we are checking is the floor-to-floor height which is set at 3.8 meters and the floor-to-ceiling height which is 2.9 meters on standard office floors.
### The claim is made in the architectur report, page 17

### The reason we chose this claim is that the cealing information in the reports are limited and the chosen report is the only one that adresses the floor-to-ceiling height.
